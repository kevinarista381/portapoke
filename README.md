[FEATURES YOU MIGHT MISS]

1. Time-based Background Images : This website's background changes depending on the local time in which you open this site. 6 AM - 5 PM is considered Daytime, 5PM - 7PM is considered Dusk/Twilight, and 7 PM - 6AM is considered Nighttime. This also affects the battle background on the 'Battle' tab on Pokemon Details page. 

2. Legendaries/Mythical Pokemon Encounter Text : Legendary or Mythical Pokemon wont have "A wild ..." phrase on the encounter text to stay faithful to the original Pokemon games.

3. The Pokemon #50 Diglett and #51 Dugtrio dont hop if you hover over them in the PC Box, unlike other Pokemon.
